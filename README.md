### What is the project?

This project is to build a simple, browser-accessible to-do app. This will be created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will append the list of languages (and if necessary, frameworks) as needed. 

### Minimum viable product

The minimum viable product is an app that allows the creation and deletion of to-do activities.

### Nice to haves

- Browser reminders
- Projects (tasks within larger tasks)
- Editing of existing tasks
